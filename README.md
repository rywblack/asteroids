# Asteroids
Here is a demonstration of my asteroids game that I made in Python using Pygame. I employ various Object Oriented Programming concepts such as Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation and Polymorphism. 

I Implemented a game loop that spawns the player in an asteroid field, allowing them to shoot and break asteroids into smaller pieces. Enhanced gameplay by adding player acceleration for smoother controls and increased challenge.
