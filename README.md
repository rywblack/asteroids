# Asteroids
Here is a demonstration of my asteroids game that I made in Python using Pygame. I employ various Object Oriented Programming concepts such as Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation and Polymorphism. 

I utilize a simple game loop which spawns the player inside an asteroid field in where the player can shoot at incoming asteroids that breakup into smaller ones, and must avoid being hit. I also added acceleration to the player for more fluid and challenging gameplay.
